    "## Ch 8 (3 of 3) Saving Variables with Shelve module\n",
    "\n",
    "You can save variables in your Python programs to binary shelf files using the `shelve` module. This way, your program can restore data to variables from the hard drive. The shelve module will let you add **Save** and **Open** features to your program. For example, if you ran a program and entered some configuration settings, you could save those settings to a shelf file and then have the program load them the next time it is run."

    "After running the code below on Windows you'll see 3 new files in the cwd -- `mydata.bak`, `mydata.dat`, and `mydata.dir`. On OS X only a single `mydata.db` file will be created. These binary files contain the data you stored in your shelf. The format of these binary files is not important; you only need to know what the shelve module does, not how it does it. The module frees you from worrying about how to store your program’s data to a file."
