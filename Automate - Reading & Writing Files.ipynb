    "The functions covered in the next few sections will apply to **plaintext files**. Plaintext files contain only basic text characters and do not include font, size, or color information. Text files with the `.txt` extension or Python script files with the `.py` extension are examples of plaintext files. These can be opened with Windows’s Notepad or OS X’s TextEdit application. Your programs can easily read the contents of plaintext files and treat them as an ordinary string value.\n",
